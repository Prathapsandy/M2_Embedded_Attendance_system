# Requirements
## Introduction
As the non renewable energy resources are decreasing, use of renewable resources for producing electricity is increasing. Solar panels are becoming more popular day by day. We have already read a post about how to install solar panel for home. Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.This energy can be utilized when required or can be used as a direct alternative to the grid supply. Utilization of the energy stored in batteries is mentioned in below given applications.The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent.

## Research
Two light dependent resistors are arranged on the edges of the solar panel. Light dependent resistors produce low resistance when light falls on them. The servo motor connected to the panel rotates the panel in the direction of Sun. Panel is arranged in such a way that light on two LDRs is compared and panel is rotated towards LDR which have high intensity

## Feature and Timeline

-   The system is fast, user friendly.
-   The system is more accurate and clear, it is very unique.

## SWOT ANALYSIS

### Strength

-   Trackers generate more electricity than their stationary

### Weakness

-   more expensive

### Opportunity

-   Tracking Sun

### Threats

-   Fixed racking accommodates harsher environmental conditions more easily than tracking systems.

## 4W and 1H

### Who

-   Large Farm owners.

### What

-   Sun tracking solar panel.

### When

-   Instead of using large amount of electricty use solar to reduce the usage of electricity.

### Where

-   Industry, farm.

### How

-   Tracking of sun and absorb energy and produce electricity
